Ideas for future features/improvements:

Change callback which retrieves constants/gains after simulation.
Ideally this should just go in and find all the constant/gain
blocks, get their values and store them.  The code for this is
already written in the function getParameters2.m.  I just have
to change the callback to actually use that function.  Waiting
until I finish this sequence of experiments.

Implement a time-since-last-control-mode-change readout.
This would be useful for determining how long you've been in
crosswind mode (in case you forgot, like I often do).  It would
basically be a re-settable clock block.

Change all image processing blocks to instances of a library block.
This means changes would be applied uniformly across all blocks.
This would be a bit of work though.

Hide a bunch of the labels.

Implement digital readout of position and orientation on target machine.

Implement closed loop control of flow speed (obviously a big,
long-term project).

Edit for variable-naming consistency.  (camel case + descriptors, 
not variables)

There seems to be an error whereby yaw causes the system to measure
roll.  Not sure how to fix that with the current implementation.
My theoretical version based on projections of lines wouldn't have
this problem though.

Correction for Snells law?

Correction for lens distortion?
